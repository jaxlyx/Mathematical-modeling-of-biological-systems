# single neuron dynamics
## This is the final project for biomodel course in USTC, finished by three people, lyx, lpr and crx.
## Category
### demo part: Our demo is mainly composed by three parts, single neuron, relationship between neurons, relationships between different neuron networks.
### models: We mainly use the following three models to initiate the dynamic changes in a neuron network:
#### Izhikevins: for the single neurons
#### small-world network: for the relationship between neurons
#### kuramoto: relationships between different neuron networks
### output: We choose several characters of the network to show the advantages of our work.
